🌫️ Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning
This project presents a machine learning-based approach to analyze and predict air quality using historical environmental data. By leveraging pollutant concentration levels and meteorological parameters, the system aims to forecast the Air Quality Index (AQI), offering insights that can aid in environmental monitoring and public health decision-making.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset (air_quality_dataset.csv) includes multiple features relevant to air pollution and weather conditions:

Air Pollutants: PM2.5, PM10, NO₂, CO, O₃

Meteorological Parameters: Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed

Target Variable: Air Quality Index (AQI)

The data undergoes preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and is then used for training and evaluating predictive models.
